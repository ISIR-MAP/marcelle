# Examples

A few examples are available on [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/@marcelle.crew/marcelle-examples). More advanced examples using Rollup, Webpack, or with custom modules are available with the source code on [Github](https://github.com/marcellejs/marcelle-next).

## Basic dashboard

A project implementing a simple image classifier using Mobilenet embeddings for feature extraction and a Multilayer perceptron for classification. The application allows you to record examples, train the model and test its performance, and play with real-time image classification.
