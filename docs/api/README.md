## Overview

_Marcelle_ presents itself as a collection of reactive **modules** embedding the state and logic for particular tasks. Modules are the building blocks of a _Marcelle_ application and handle various tasks such as capturing images from a webcam, defining a new dataset, instancing a Deep Neural Network (DNN), displaying a confusion matrix, or monitoring the confidence of a model prediction, to name a few. _Marcelle_ provides two mechanisms to build user interfaces with modules: **dashboards** and **wizards**. Dashboards are applications containing multiple pages where developers can display the views of various modules. Wizards can be programmed to guide end-users or novices through a series of steps.
